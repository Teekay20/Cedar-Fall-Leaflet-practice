INTERACTIVE MAP WITH MARKERS AND POPUPS

This project features an interactive map built with React, Leaflet, and react-leaflet. It displays predefined locations in Cedar Falls, Iowa, USA, each with a custom marker. Clicking a location in the sidebar highlights its marker, opens a popup, and shows details such as the name and an image of the place.
